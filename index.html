                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Stephen Helman. I have only been programming for a few weeks.
                    I am on my way to becoming a full stack engineer. This is the first iteration
                    of my portfolio page.<br><br>
                    I have had "the programming itch," if you will, for a couple of years now. It
                    all started when I was participating in day trading. With the free subscription
                    of Trading View, you could only use 3 indicators. Indicators are functions that
                    take different points from the market and creates a visual representation on your
                    chart. I wanted to be able to have as many indicators as I wanted. So even with the 
                    free version of Trading View, you could create your own indicators using PineSript,
                    which is heavily based on JavaScript. SO I would write functions that would combine
                    the code of many different indicators, and display them all on my chart at the same
                    time. I then moved to creating brand new functions that could portray the way I liked
                    to trade. <br><br>
                    From there, I moved into creating discord bots using JavaScript. The bots were programmed
                    to take a user input from the discord server, and add that information to a google sheet.
                    The google sheet would then format the information so it could be used in an API call to 
                    add that information into a CRM that my company was using. The information would create
                    a customer, send a request for a proposal to be built, send information to our Google 
                    Calendar to set up an appointment, and finally the bot would send a confirmation message 
                    to the server, taggin the original user, to let them know the information was added 
                    successfully. Unfortunately, all of this programming came without any formal knowledge
                    on the subject. It was a lot of trial and error.<br><br>
                    Now I am at the point where I am enrolled in an official course, to teach me the skills I 
                    need to land an actual job. So with all that said, welcome to my Portfolio!
