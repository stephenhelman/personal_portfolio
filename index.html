                    <h2>What was Stephen's life like growing up?</h2>
                    <p>I was born and raised in a west Texas town known as El Paso. Not much happens here, but I call it home. <br><br>
                        As a child, I enjoyed learning new things. I loved math and watching rugrats. Math has always been a strong subject for me.
                        As I grew up, I grew to love music. I self taught myself how to play piano, and sang in choir from elementary school, all the way until I graduated
                        high school. <br><br>
                        Growing up, I only had one older brother. He left home and joined the Army when I was in 6th grade. So for most of my growing up, it was only my Mom
                        and I. We took care of each other and made sure that we got things done that we had to get done. <br><br>
                        I sort of coasted through high school. Alwasy got good grades, but because I did not apply myself more, I did not graduate top 10. I always knew I 
                        could achieve more if I put my mind to it. <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, I did not go straight into college. Instead I entered the workforce so I could start making some money!</p>

                    <h2>What kind of work has Stephen done?</h2>
                    <p>My first job was delivering newspapers. I worked this job alongside my Mom. We woke up every morning at 2 AM and had to finish delivering by 6 AM.
                        I started this job in high school, and left when I was up for a management position at my next job... <br><br>
                        I then worked at Pizza Hut. I started out as a delivery driver. Over the course of 6 years, I worked my way up to Shift Manager, Assistant Manager,
                        and finally General Manager. As a General Manager, I got my first taste of programming. I self taught myself how to use Excel, creating functions,
                        comparing numbers. I used this to run my profit and loss statements and see where I could achieve the most profitabiility in the business. <br><br>
                        Shortly after Pizza Hut, I had a few stints in sales. First I sold life insurance. During that time, I recreated our quoting software in Excel 
                        because they were updating the software, and we the only quoting software we had was convoluted and complicated. I took the weekend and recreated 
                        everything in Excel using lookup, if, and other functions. I also sold solar for 6 months. I was only a door knocker though. Used my people 
                        skills I learned at Pizza Hut to generate leads. Unfortunately this didn't work the best...so I went back to the service industry. Right 
                        at the time COVID started.... <br><br>
                        I went to work at Carl's Jr as a cook. After 3 weeks, I interviewed for a General Manager position and was promoted almost immediately. I 
                        utilized the skills I had at Pizza Hut, as well as the logistical experience to run 2 separate locations. I left after a year due to 
                        terrible working conditions brought upon by COVID. <br><br>
                        I then attempted to start my own business through a network marketing opportunity focused on trading in the foreign exchange market. 
                        This is where I got my first actual taste of programming. After a short while I started writing scripts for my own trading strategies 
                        and algorithms. My business failed, when the trading I was affiliated with closed its doors. I needed money fast, so I turned to 
                        sales once again. <br><br>
                        Finally, we have reached my current job. For the last 2 years, I have been selling solar. I make enough money to pay my bills. But the
                        market is chagning rapidly. somewhat for the worst for sales reps. Copanies that used to be juggernauts are filing bankruptcy, and 
                        other companies are not paying their reps commissions. So I figured it was time for me to work on establishing a skill set that 
                        will give me a great career, that will pay me kindly for that service. So I have arrived at programming....</p>

                    <h2>What is Stephen's programming journey look like?</h2>
                    <p>I have had "the programming itch," if you will, for a couple of years now. It all started when I was participating in day trading. 
                        With the free subscription of Trading View, you could only use 3 indicators. Indicators are functions that take different points 
                        from the market and creates a visual representation on your chart. I wanted to be able to have as many indicators as I wanted. 
                        So even with the free version of Trading View, you could create your own indicators using PineSript, which is heavily based on 
                        JavaScript. So I would write functions that would combine the code of many different indicators, and display them all on my 
                        chart at the same time. I then moved to creating brand new functions that could portray the way I liked to trade. <br><br>
                        From there, I moved into creating discord bots using JavaScript. The bots were programmed to take a user input from the 
                        discord server, and add that information to a google sheet. The google sheet would then format the information so it could 
                        be used in an API call to add that information into a CRM that my company was using. The information would create a customer, 
                        send a request for a proposal to be built, send information to our Google  Calendar to set up an appointment, and finally, the 
                        bot would send a confirmation message to the server, tagging the original user, to let them know the information was added 
                        successfully. Unfortunately, all of this programming came without any formal knowledge on the subject. It was a lot of trial 
                        and error.<br><br>
                        Now I am at the point where I am enrolled in an official course, to teach me the skills I need to land an actual job. 
                        So with all that said, welcome to my portfolio!</p>
